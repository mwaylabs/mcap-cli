## Update

To get the latest updates run `npm update` in the `mcap-cli` directory.



## Usage

Just run `mcap` in your command line



### Commands

Usage:
```
mcap [--version] [--help] [--loglevel=<level>]
```

The most commonly used mcap commands are:
```
new           # Create a new mCAP project
help          # Show helpful resources to work with the mCAP
server
  add         # Add a new server
  remove      # Remove a specific server
  list        # Show all configured servers
component
  model       # Add a new model
```



## Debug

By setting the loglevel, you can easily follow the programm flow. The levels are: trace, debug, info, warn, error, and fatal.

- "fatal" (60): The service/app is going to stop or become unusable now. An operator should definitely look into this soon.
- "error" (50): Fatal for a particular request, but the service/app continues servicing other requests. An operator should look at this soon(ish).
- "warn" (40): A note on something that should probably be looked at by an operator eventually.
- "info" (30): Detail on regular operation.
- "debug" (20): Anything else, i.e. too verbose to be included in "info" level.
- "trace" (10): Logging from external libraries used by your app or very detailed application logging.

```
mcap <command> --loglevel=trace
```
